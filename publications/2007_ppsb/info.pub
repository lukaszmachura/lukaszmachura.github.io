abstract::Kinetics of magnetic flux in a thin mesoscopic ring biased by a strong external magnetic field is described equivalently by dynamics of a Brownian particle in a tilted washboard potential. The ‘flux velocity’, i.e. the averaged time derivative of the total magnetic flux in the ring, is a candidate for a novel characteristics of mesoscopic rings. Its global properties reflect the possibility of accommodating persistent currents in the ring.
