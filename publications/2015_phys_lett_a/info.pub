title::Persistent currents in metallic rings containing a quantum dot
author::L. Machura and J. Luczka
abstract::Currents in a metallic ring with a quantum dot  are studied in the framework of a Langevin equation for a magnetic flux passing through the ring.  Two scenarios are considered: one in which thermal fluctuations of the dissipative part of the current are modelled by classical Johnson-Nyquist noise  and one in which quantum character of thermal fluctuations is taken into account in  terms of  a quantum Smoluchowski equation. The impact of the amplitude and phase of the transmission coefficient of the electron through a quantum dot on  current characteristics is analyzed. In  tailored parameter regimes, both scenarios can exhibit the transition from para-- to diamagnetic response of the ring current versus external magnetic flux.
