abstract::Assessment of complex motor task (CMT) competency is still very prone to bias. Objective assessment is based either on outcomes leaving the process out of the equitation or on checklists with all their limitations. We tested the hypothesis that muscular recruitment patters assessed with surface Electromyography (sEMG) will be different between novices and skilled trainees. sEMG signals of the muscles that potentially are characterized by the highest level of engagement at complex motor task were submitted to comprehensive correlation analysis. Standard methods of estimating the correlation coefficients were compared with more advanced analysis including cross-wavelet coherence and calculation of mutual information. We conclude that with appropriate analytical tools it is possible to compare sEMG signals during complex motor tasks and that at least on our very small sample it differs between individuals.
