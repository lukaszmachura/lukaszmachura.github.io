abstract::The description of intervals between electrical pulses generated by electrical activity of motor units of an external anal sphincter are studied at four stages of rectal cancer treatment. The surface electromyography data were acquired from the patients with colorectal cancer at four distinct stages of treatment. The probability distribution of inter-pulse intervals are calculated for the normalized signals in order to compare the properties of the series due to the time elapsed since the operation. It is found that the probability distribution re-scaled with an average interval time can be described by means of the stretched exponential function with the threshold dependent scale and shape parameters and does not exhibit significant differences for any considered stages on average. Long range strong correlations together with the absence of the clustering effects in the subsequent inter-pulse intervals give rise to the conclusion that the knowledge on the probability distribution function of such intervals is sufficient to fully describe its statistical properties.
