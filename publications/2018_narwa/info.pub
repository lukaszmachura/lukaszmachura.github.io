abstract::The information theory provides a spectrum of nonlinear methods capable to grasp an internal structure of the signal together with an insight into its complex nature. In this work, we would discuss the usefulness of various entropy techniques for a description of the information carried by the surface electromyography signals during the colorectal cancer treatment. The electrical activity of external anal sphincter can serve as a potential source of knowledge of the actual state of the patient who underwent a common surgery for rectal cancer in the form of anterior or lower anterior resection. The results of well-known Shannon and Spectral parameters were compared with the values of the Sample Entropy. The analysis of the latter has been extended to multiple time scales in terms of the Multiscale Sample Entropy. The specific values of the entropy measures and their dependence on the time scales were analyzed due to the time elapsed since the operation, the type of surgical treatment and also the different depths the rectum canal. The Mann Whithney U test and Anova Friedman statistics indicate the statistically significant differences among all of stages of treatment and for all consecutive depths of rectum area for the estimated Sample Entropy. The further analysis of Sample Entropy at the multiple time scales signify the substantial differences among compared stages of treatment in the group of patients who underwent lower anterior resection.
