abstract::Introduction: Disturbances of day/night cycle, sleep deprivation and stress may have influence on Central Nervous System function. Saccades and anti-saccades are useful tools for functional CNS assessment. Material and methods: 25 nurses form 2 departments in busy trauma center were included. They underwent saccadometry (Saccadometer, Ober Consulting, Poland) before and after 12 hour night shift. On both occasions they performed pro and anti-saccades. Waist-to- Hip ratio and some social parameters including number of kids, partner, additional work were recorded. Results: For pro-saccades Latency (190,75 vs 208,33), Promptness (5,9 vs 5,54) and Duration (53,79 vs 55,25) reached significance when compared pre to post night shift. For anti-saccades Duration (71,25 vs 81,63) and Mean velocity (244,21 vs 203) were significant. When grouped based on WHR: Latency, Promptness, Duration,  Amplitude and Mean Velocity differentiated the groups based on pro-saccades parameters and Duration, Maximum and Mean Velocity based on anti-saccades parameters. Saccades latency was significantly different between nurses with partner/husband vs those without while additional work had influence only on anti-saccades Latency after the night shift. Conclusions: night shifts, Waist-to-Hip Ratio, other than work daily obligations including family duties, kids and second work have significant influence on saccades and anti-saccades.
