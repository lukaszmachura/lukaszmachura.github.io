title::Magnetic flux in mesoscopic rings: capacity, inertia and kinetics
author::J. Dajka, S. Rogoziński, Ł. Machura, and J. Łuczka
abstract::We consider mesoscopic non-superconducting rings with an effective capacitance. We propose a Hamiltonian model describing magnetic flux in such rings. Next we incorporate dissipation and thermal fluctuations into our kinetic model. We consider kinetics in limiting regimes of strong and weak coupling to thermal bath.
