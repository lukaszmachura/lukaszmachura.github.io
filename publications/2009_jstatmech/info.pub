title::Transmission of magnetic signals in noisy mesorings
author::L. Machura, J. Dajka and J. ≈Åuczka
abstract::A linear array of co-planar magnetically coupled mesoscopic non-superconducting rings is considered. Propagation of an alternating magnetic flux driving one of the rings can be effectively controlled by means of the properties of rings. We report the observation of the phase lag, vibrational amplification and rectification of periodic signals.
