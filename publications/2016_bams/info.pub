abstract::In this work the multifractal analysis of the kinesiological surface electromyographic signal is proposed. The goal was to investigate the level of neuromuscular activation during complex movements on the laparoscopic trainer. The basic issue of this work concerns the changes observed in the signal obtained from the complete beginner in the field of using laparoscopic tools and the same person subjected to the series of training. To quantify the complexity of the kinesiological sEMG, the nonlinear analysis technique, namely the MultiFractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis was adopted. The analysis  was based on the parameters describing the multifractal spectrum -- Hurst exponent and the spectrum width. The statistically significant differences for a selected group of muscles at the different states (before and after training) are presented. Additionally, as the base case, the relaxation state was considered and compared with the working states.
