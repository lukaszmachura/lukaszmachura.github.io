title::Transport driven by biharmonic forces: impact of correlated thermal noise
author::Ł. Machura and J. Łuczka
abstract::We study an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric periodic substrate, driven by a zero-mean biharmonic force and correlated thermal noise. The Brownian motion  is described in terms of  a Generalized Langevin Equation with an exponentially correlated Gaussian  noise term, obeying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We analyse impact of non-zero correlation time of thermal noise  on transport properties of the Brownian particle.   We  identify  regimes where the increase of the correlation time intensifies long-time  transport  of the Brownian particle. The opposite effect is also found: longer correlation time reduces the stationary velocity of the particle.  The correlation time induced multiple current reversal  is  detected. We reveal that thermal noise of non-zero correlation time can radically enhance  long-time velocity  of the Brownian particle in regimes where in the white noise limit the velocity  is extremely small. All transport properties can be tested in the setup consisting of a resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson junction device.
