title::Mesoscopic rings: multi-states induced by quantum thermal fluctuations
author::J. Dajka, L. Machura, S. Rogoziński and J. Łuczka 
abstract::When temperature of a conducting mesoscopic ring is decreased, the magnetic flux states can change drastically, e.g. from bistable to multistable states. Possibility of the application of the multistability of the magnetic flux is emphasised in the information-theoretical context. The proposal of the quantum kinetics description is qualitatively discussed.
