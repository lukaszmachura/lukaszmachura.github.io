abstract::Potassium channels play an important physiological role in glioma cells. In particular, voltage- and $Ca^{2+}$-activated large-conductance BK channels (gBK in gliomas) are involved in intensive growth and extensive migrating behavior of the mentioned tumor cells, thus, they may be considered as a drug target in therapeutic treatment of glioblastoma. To enable appropriate drug design, molecular mechanisms of gBK channel activation by diverse stimuli should be unraveled, as well as the way that the specific conformational states of the channel relates to its functional properties (conducting/non-conducting). There is an open debate about the actual mechanism of BK channel gating, including the question of how the channel proteins undergo a range of conformational transitions when they flicker between non-conducting (functionally closed) and conducting (open) states. The details of channel conformational diffusion ought to have its representation in the properties of the experimental signal which describes the ion channel activity. Non-linear methods of analysis of experimental non-stationary series can be useful for observing the changes in the number of channel substates available from a geometrical and energetic point of view at given external conditions. In this work we analyze whether multifractal properties of activity of glioblastoma BK channels depend on membrane potential, and which states, conducting or nonconducting, affect the total signal to the larger extent. In this aim we carried out patch-clamp experiments at different levels of membrane hyper- and depolarization. The obtained time series of single channel currents were analyzed by the use of the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) method in a standard form and incorporating focus-based multifractal (FMF) formalism. Thus, we show the applicability of a modified MFDFA technique in analysis of an experimental patch clamp time series. The obtained results suggest that membrane potential strongly affects conformational space of the gBK channel proteins and the considered process has non-linear multifractal characteristics. These properties are inherent features of analyzed signals due to the fact that main tendencies vanish after shuffling the data.
